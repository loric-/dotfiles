Shortcuts have been designed to be used with a BÃ©po keyboard layout. Here are the tools included.

 - i3wm
 - tmux
 - vim
 - less
 - sublime text
 - ranger
 - zshrc

Graphical and terminal application configurations are split in two different folders.

## Install script

    # with gui bindings
    make link
    
    # only terminal binding
    make term-link

## Docker

A Dockerfile is implemented to build an environment with only terminal based applications.

    # build
    make docker

    # run
    docker run --rm -ti --name dotfiles -e TERM=$TERM -v $(pwd):/home/dev/Lab lobre/dotfiles

## Generate ISO

    make iso

## Shortcut reference table

Shortcuts tend to be consistent between apps. Here is a table listing a few of them.

|                            | Home                            | Ctrl-W                         | Ctrl-Space                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| c/t/s/r                    | [i3] switch containers          | [vim] switch panes             | [tmux] switch panes            |
| n/p                        | [i3] next/previous workspace    | [vim] next/previous buffer     | [tmux] next/previous window    |
| q                          | [i3] close window               | [vim] close window             | [tmux] close pane              |
| g                          | [i3] rofi window switcher       |                                | [tmux] copy mode               |
| /-                         | [i3] split orientation          | [vim] split window             | [tmux] split pane              |
| z                          | [i3] full screen                |                                | [tmux] zoom pane               |
|                            |                                 |                                |                                |

## Colors

Colors are generated from a base 16 template. See `.Xresources` to check colors. These colors are propagated from X resources to other apps.

 - Uxrvt
 - Rofi
 - i3
 - Polybar
 - Dunst

Colors can be easily visualized using https://terminal.sexy.

## Icons

A pached font from [nerdfonts](https://nerdfonts.com) is used. It contains a large list of icons. In order to copy them into configuration files, the tool `gucharmap` can be handy.

## Visual Studio Code

The configuration of `vscode` is saved in this repo but the list of extensions does not save automatically. Here is the command to update the list of extensions.

    code --list-extensions | xargs -L 1 echo code --install-extension >| graphical/.config/Code/extensions.sh

This script can then be used to restore and install extensions.
