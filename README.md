# DOTFILES

Configuration files for linux

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

Shortcuts have been designed to be used with a BÃ©po keyboard layout. Here are the tools included.

 - i3wm
 - tmux
 - vim
 - less
 - sublime text
 - ranger
 - zshrc
 - sshrc

Graphical and terminal application configurations are split in two different folders.

## Install script

A python 3 script has been created to easily symlink files.

    python3 link.py

## Docker

A Dockerfile is implemented to build an environment with only terminal based applications.

    docker build -t lobre/dotfiles .
    docker run --rm -ti --name dotfiles -v $(pwd):/home/dev/lab lobre/dotfiles


## Shortcut reference table

Shortcuts tend to be consistent between apps. Here is a table listing a few of them.

## Colors

Colors can be generated from https://terminal.sexy. Then, they are exportable as JSON and the following script can convert them to the good format for `~/.Xresources`.

    python3 jsonToXres.py

### Details on colors

 - color0: has to be different of background for proper display in htop
 - color4: main accent color used by polybar and i3

## Todo

- [ ] i3 auto update when display switched
- [ ] Test docker image
- [ ] Check vim ssh sessions (quick open vim session with rofi)
- [ ] Dockerfile install golang
