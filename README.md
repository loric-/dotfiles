# DOTFILES

Configuration files for linux

![Screenshot](https://github.com/lobre/dotfiles/raw/master/screenshot.png)

Shortcuts have been designed to be used with a BÃ©po keyboard layout. Here are the tools included.

 - i3wm
 - tmux
 - vim
 - less
 - sublime text
 - ranger
 - zshrc
 - sshrc

Graphical and terminal application configurations are split in two different folders.

## Install script

A python 3 script has been created to easily symlink files.

    python3 link.py

## Docker

A Dockerfile is implemented to build an environment with only terminal based applications.

    docker build -t lobre/dotfiles .
    docker run --rm -ti --name dotfiles -e TERM=$TERM -v $(pwd):/home/dev/Lab lobre/dotfiles

## Vagrant

A Vagrantfile at the root of the project allows the provisioning of an Ubuntu 16.04 box with all the graphical and terminal tools installed.

    vagrant up
    vagrant provision

It takes around 30 min to provision the whole box.

Then, the package control for sublime text has to be manually installed. `lxappearance` can help changing the gtk theme and `nitrogen` can be used for setting a wallpaper.

## Shortcut reference table

Shortcuts tend to be consistent between apps. Here is a table listing a few of them.
