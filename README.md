![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

Shortcuts have been designed to be used with a BÃ©po keyboard layout. Here are the tools included.

 - i3wm
 - tmux
 - vim
 - less
 - sublime text
 - ranger
 - zshrc
 - sshrc

Graphical and terminal application configurations are split in two different folders.

## Install script

A python 3 script has been created to easily symlink files.

    python3 link.py

## Docker

A Dockerfile is implemented to build an environment with only terminal based applications.

    docker build -t lobre/dotfiles .
    docker run --rm -ti --name dotfiles -v $(pwd):/home/dev/Lab lobre/dotfiles


## Shortcut reference table

Shortcuts tend to be consistent between apps. Here is a table listing a few of them.

## Colors

Colors are generated from a base 16 template. See `.Xresources` to check colors. These colors are propagated from X resources to other apps.

 - Uxrvt
 - Rofi
 - i3
 - Polybar
 - Dunst

Colors can be easily visualized using https://terminal.sexy.
